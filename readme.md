# Friendship globe

The friendship globe symbolizes the friendships we have made by joining the MLP Fandom.

## Inspiration

At the end of r/place 2023 moderators of [bronyplace](https://discord.gg/bronyplace) were talking about not losing these bonds between the friends we made during r/place 2023 and one of them said something along the lines of  "Just because we can't put a rainbow across the globe doesn't mean we can't find other ways to express our friendship towards one another" and that got me thinking if we can't physically stretch a rainbow across the globe why not do it virtually? So that night I started to work on this.
